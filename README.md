## Before you begin
- Ensure you have your test (and live) [API keys](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/api-keys).

## Requirements
- The minimum supported SDK version is 15
- Rave android sdk 1.0.50 and above only supports projects that have been migrated to [androidx](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/). For more information, read Google's [migration guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate).

## Adding it to your project


**Step 1.** Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
    allprojects {
		repositories {
			//...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```
**Step 2.** Add the dependency

If you want to use the default Drop In UI, add the `rave-android` module dependency
```groovy
    dependencies {
	     implementation 'implementation 'com.github.mikelis135:rave-android:1.1.13'
	}
```
**Step 3.** Add the  `INTERNET` permission to your android manifest

     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /> 


> The steps below show how to use the Flutterwave Android SDK as a Drop-in UI (all the views for the payment process are handled by the SDK).

## Usage
### For using the default UI
###  1. Create a `RaveUiManager` instance
Set the public key, encryption key and other required parameters. The `RaveUiManager` accepts a mandatory instance of the calling `Fragment` and an instance of the parent `Activity`).

        new RaveUiManager(fragment).setAmount(amount)
                        .setCurrency(currency)
                        .setEmail(email)
                        .setfName(fName)
                        .setlName(lName)

                        .setPublicKey(publicKey)
                        .setEncryptionKey(encryptionKey)
                        .setTxRef(txRef)
                        .setPhoneNumber(phoneNumber, boolean)

                        .acceptUgMobileMoneyPayments(boolean)
                        .acceptZmMobileMoneyPayments(boolean)
                        .acceptRwfMobileMoneyPayments(boolean)
                        .acceptSaBankPayments(boolean)
                        .acceptUkPayments(boolean)

                        .onStagingEnv(boolean)
                        .setMeta(List<Meta>)
                        .withTheme(styleId)
                        .isPreAuth(boolean)
                        .setSubAccounts(List<SubAccount>)
                        .shouldDisplayFee(boolean)
                        .showStagingLabel(boolean)
			    .embedFragment(int, appcompatActivity)
                        .initialize();

###  2. Handle the response
In the calling Frgament, use the setFragmentResultListener method to receive the payment response as shown below
```java
	getParentFragmentManager().setFragmentResultListener(RAVE_REQUEST_KEY, this, new FragmentResultListener() {
	  
            @Override
            public void onFragmentResult(@NonNull String requestKey, @NonNull Bundle result) {
		
		int resultCode = result.getInt("resultCode");
                int requestCode = result.getInt("requestCode");
		
			/*
			 *  We advise you to do a further verification of transaction's details on your server to be
			 *  sure everything checks out before providing service or goods.
			*/
	
         	if (requestCode == RaveConstants.RAVE_REQUEST_CODE && result != null) {

			String message = result.getString("response");

			    if (message != null) {
				Log.d("rave response", message);
			    }

			    if (resultCode == RavePayActivity.RESULT_SUCCESS) {
				Toast.makeText(requireContext(), "SUCCESS " + message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
			    } else if (resultCode == RavePayActivity.RESULT_ERROR) {
				Toast.makeText(requireContext(), "ERROR " + message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
			    } else if (resultCode == RavePayActivity.RESULT_CANCELLED) {
